# Monkey Interpreter

This repository contains my implementation of the Monkey programming language interpreter, as described in the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball.

## About

The Monkey language is a fictional programming language created for educational purposes. This repository serves as my personal journey in understanding the mechanics of how interpreters work and is purely for learning and experimentation.

## Credits

All credit goes to Thorsten Ball for creating such a comprehensive guide in "Writing An Interpreter In Go". I highly recommend his book(s) for anyone interested in delving into the world of interpreters and compilers.
